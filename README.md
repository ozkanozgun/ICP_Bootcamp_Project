# ICP_Bootcamp_Project
This repo is to complete my application to ICP Internship Bootcamp.
I have submitted a "Web3 Use Case" project in "Transition to Web3" bootcamp in Rise In. 
This project is related to that use case. However, writing the complete Motoko code for a decentralized freelance marketplace with the specified features would be an extensive task,
but I can provide you with a simplified example focusing on the key components: decentralized job matching and blind hiring. 
Note that the following code is a starting point and may need further refinement based on the specific requirements. 
You can find the use case project file in backend src folder.
