    // I have submitted a "Web3 Use Case" project in "Transition to Web3" bootcamp in Rise In. This project is related to that use case. However, writing the complete Motoko code for a decentralized freelance marketplace with the specified features would be an extensive task, but I can provide you with a simplified example focusing on the key components: decentralized job matching and blind hiring. Note that the following code is a starting point and may need further refinement based on the specific requirements. You can find the file in backend src folder.

  // Define a Freelancer structure

    id: Nat;
    title: Text;
    description: Text;
    skillsRequired: [Text];
    isOpen: Bool;
    // Add other relevant details
  };

  // Define the FairLance smart contract
  public type FairLance = {
    // Mapping of freelancer IDs to Freelancer details
    freelancers: [Nat] -> Freelancer;
    // Mapping of job IDs to Job details
    jobs: [Nat] -> Job;
